# Database-project
Final project of database course, Dr Momtazi (fall 2020)

In this project, a database for a chain library  is designed which includes tables for books, authors, etc and uses the concepts like functions, triggers and roles in sql.

To use the codes, first run the tables.sql file to create tables and then run the other codes.
Some test cases are added to the checking.sql file.
